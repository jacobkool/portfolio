### Jacob Kool React-TypeScript-Portfolio

Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I am proud of this project as it has taken bits of everything I've learned and put it all together.

The page layout and formatting is done using CSS Grid and Flexbox. Each section is a different React Component rendered into the parent component. This was my first project using TypeScript, and I will admit I was amazed at how few times I had to debug in the browser compared to previous projects! 

I have been studying front-end development for a while now, so to be able to build this portfolio site to show it all means the world to me.

There are three sections to the portfolio. First, I highlight my tech stack and talk about some of the resources I've used for learning. 

Next, I've used React-Elastic-Carousel to have show three of my projects that I've created. I am excited to continue adding projects to this list! 

Finally, using another third party library, react-card-flipper, I have some ways to get in touch and connect with me.
